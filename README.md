# HR Analytics Dashboard â€“ Attrition Insights

- *Salary Influence:* Employees earning up to $5K are leaving the most.
- *Tenure Impact:* Most employees leave within their first year (0-1 years).
- *Role-Specific Attrition:* Lab technicians, research scientists, and sales representatives are the roles with the highest turnover.
- *Age Group Analysis:* Employees aged 26-35 are leaving at a higher rate than other age groups.

## Tools Used
- *Power BI:* For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- *Excel:* For data cleaning and processing.
